      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML elements composes of opening and closing tags. 
        <li>Hypertext Markdown Language gives content structure.</li> 
        <li>It is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li> 
        <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and basic framework for all pages on the web page.</li> 
        <li>These elements are text, header, image, and list.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage and isn't seen by the user.</li>
        <li>Head element contains the metadata.</li>
        <li>Body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Elements are also used to divide the content to browsers and other devs.</li>
        <li>The elements types that divide and describe a page are meta-related, content division and semantic elements.</li>
        <li>HTML attributes defines additional information about an element.</li>
        <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
        <li>!DOCTYPE tells the browser what the type of document it should to except to open.</li>
        <li>Metadata is data about a webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve the webpage to users.</li>
        <li>Title element defines the title of a webpage, in other words the tab at top of browser.</li>
        <li>Style element defines CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
        <li>Base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
        <li>Link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
        <li>Meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author and viewport.</li>
        <li>Script element embeds clients side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
        <li>Html lang="en" tells the browser the language on the webpage, en = english.</li>
        <li>Tags will only appear inside the angle brackets. Ex: < h1 >, h1 is the tag.</li>
        <li>H1 - H6 elements will give text a larger, prominent title to organize a webpage. Should only appear once each page.</li>
        <li>Elements that are listed in other elements are called child elements.</li>
        <li>Parent element houses the child elements.</li>
        <li>< p > = element for paragraph.</li>
        <li>< ul > = element for a bulleted list.</li>
        <li>< ol > = a numbered list.</li>
        <li>< li > = list items.</li>
        <li>< img scr="image link" alt="image name">.</li>
        <li>Alt attribute in < img > element contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
        <li>Alt text can improve search engine rankings of a website.</li>
        <li>< br > = element that creates.</li>
        <li>< a > element (anchor) creates links to same webpage or other webpage.</li>
        <li>Href attribute is for the URL link, ex: < a href="link> "link name" < /a >.</li>
        <li>< header > contains the element of head elements (h1-h6), logo or icon, authorship information.</header></li>
        <li>< section > elements define a section in a document.</li>
      </ul>

     <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS, Cascading StyleSheet defines the colors, aesthetics, and visual layout of a webpage.</li>
        <li>There are three CSS style elements. Inline CSS, internal stylesheet and external stylesheet.</li>
        <li>Inline CSS is an style element directly in the HTML file.</li>
        <li>Inline style is applied to a specific HTML tag using an attribute with a CSS rule.</li>
        <li>Internal CSS contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>External CSS, most common CSS used, keeps all CSS rules in a separate file in which makes it easier to change designs.</li>
        <li>External CSS uses a file link that is placed in the < head >.</li>
        <li>Separation of concern - separating code into different files based on use.</li>
        <li>Selector defines the elements or attributes to which the rules/declaration will apply.</li>
        <li>Margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>* = is a selector that selects everything on a page. All the elements on page will have the same style properties.</li>
        <li>You can add multiple elements into a CSS style for them to look the same.</li>
        <li>DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF (DRY) encourage devs to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the # of lines in code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
        <li>CSS can be used for images as well.</li>
        <li>To connect CSS file to the index.html, navigate to directory and open code in the < head > section under < meta > and before < title >. Add code "< meta > < link rel="stylesheet" href="file name" >"".</li>
        <li>< Link > element creates connection to external file.</li>
        <li>Rel attribute specifies 'relationship" between current document and linked document resource.</li>
        <li>Href attribute specifies URL of external resources and means location of URL.</li>
        <li>Class attribute allows us to share a CSS rule to any element.</li>
        <li>.card is a class selector. Any element with card attribute will gain properties from the CSS ( CSS card attribute changes card attribute in HTML.</li>
        <li>A border assigns a border with a width and color.</li>
        <li>Box-shadow adds shadow effects around the elements frame using X and Y offsets.</li>
        <li>X defines the widths right side of box. Y defines below the box.</li>
        <li>Color = hex #.</li>

        <li>A branch is a copy or version of a code that can be worked on independently in isolation so changes wont disrupt other team members.</li>
        <li>A branch is called a main branch, we don't code on the main.</li>
        <li>We work of the main branch so we create a feature branch</li>

        <li>When changes are made push them in the repository (github).</li>
        <li>To merge changes to the main branch, open a pull request.</li>
        <li>Pull request (PR): merges a comparison/feature branch into the base/main branch.</li>
        <li>A PR will get the code reviewed and approved then merged into the main branch. The main branch will be updated. If you want to make another change it will branch off the updated branch.</li>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named character that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom.</li>
        <li>Use of conditional statements and loops is to control the order in which code is executed or if it will be executed at all.</li>
        <li>To create conditional statements we use 'if' statements.</li>
        <li>A 'if' statements is an introduction to decision making in code.</li>
        <li>When using 'if' statement the code will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true.</li>
        <li>'If' statements are written in psuedocode. Use the same3 logic and similar syntax to create 'if' statements in JavaScript.</li>
        <li>When computer encounters an 'if' statement in JS file and it is truthy. It will do what action that is asked of between the curly brackets. If the condition is falsy, it will ignore the <code>.</code> </li>
        <li>A value that is falsy has the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type false.</li>
        <li>When wanting to use more than one condition we us 'else if'.</li>
        <li>Array stores a group of data in a variable and use a 'for' loop to perform the task on each piece of data.</li>
        <li>Array can store different types of data such as strings, numbers, etc.</li>
        <li>Strings need to be within quotations.</li>
        <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to location of the data item. This location is identified with a unique number called index.</li>
        <li>Arrays are zero indexed and sequential.</li>
        <li>First item in array is 0.</li>
        <li>The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
        <li>'For' loops uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
        <li>Using 'for' loops will tell the computer to go through each data in the array and log them into the console until there are no data left.</li>
        <li>We use 'length' for the loop which needs to know how many times to run code.</li>
        <li>Length of an array is how many members are in the array.</li>
        <li>A loop contains three important statements.</li>
        <li>First loop statement determines the starting point for the loop.</li>
        <li>Second statement is condition.</li>
        <li>Third statement is what allows the array to repeat over each time.</li>
        <li>Commenting out code - makes a code inactive without deleting it.</li>
        <li>To comment out in JS put '/*' before and '*/' after the block of code.</li>
        <li>Function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
        <li>To create a function we use 'function' keyword and then give the function a name.</li>
        <li>Function name is followed by ().</li>
        <li>We can add function directly in Chrome DevTools console.</li>
        <li>After creating a function we have to call it ( function 'function name' () ). </li>
        <li>To declare a function we use the 'function' keyword and then give function a unique name followed by parentheses. We then add curly brackets that contains the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
        <li>We create two separate functions, one for 'for' loop and one for 'if' statement.</li>
        <li>We need to call the function on the code at the spot we want to execute.</li>
        <li>Place function at the top and bottom of code. All functions need to be called.</li>
        <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JS built in math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
