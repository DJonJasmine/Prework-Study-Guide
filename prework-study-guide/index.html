      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML elements composes of opening and closing tags. 
        <li>Hypertext Markdown Language gives content structure.</li> 
        <li>It is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li> 
        <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and basic framework for all pages on the web page.</li> 
        <li>These elements are text, header, image, and list.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage and isnt seen by the user.</li>
        <li>Head element contains the metadata.</li>
        <li>Body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Elements are also used to divide the content to browsers and other devs.</li>
        <li>The elements types that divide and describe a page are meta-related, content division and semantic elements.</li>
        <li>HTML attributes defines additional information about an element.</li>
        <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
        <li>!DOCTYPE tells the browser what the type of document it should to except to open.</li>
        <li>Metadata is data about a webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve the webpage to users.</li>
        <li>Title element defines the title of a webpage, in other words the tab at top of browser.</li>
        <li>Style element defines CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
        <li>Base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
        <li>Link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
        <li>Meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author and viewport.</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS, Cascading StyleSheet defines the colors, aesthetics, and visual layout of a webpage.</li>
        <li>There are three CSS stle elements. Inline CSS, internal stlyesheet and external stylesheet.</li>
        <li>Inline CSS is an style element direcrtly in the HTML file.</li>
        <li>Inline style is applied to a specific HTML tag using an attribute with a CSS rule.</li>
        <li>Internal CSS contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>External CSS, most common CSS used, keeps all CSS rules in a seperate file in which makes it easier to change designs.</li>
        <li>External CSS uses a file link that is placed in the < head >.</li>
        <li>Seperation of concern - seperating code into different files based on use.</li>
        <li>Selector defines the elements or attributes to which the rules/declaration will apply.</li>
        <li>Margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>* = is a selector that selects everything on a page. All the elements on page will have the same style properties.</li>
        <li>You can add multiple elements into a CSS style for them to look the same.</li>
        <li>DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF (DRY) encourage devs to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the # of lines in code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
        <li>CSS can be used for images as well.</li>
        <li>To connect CSS file to the index.html, navigate to directory and open code in the < head > section under < meta > and before < title >. Add code "< meta > < link rel="stylesheet" href="file name" >"".</li>
        <li>< Link > element creates connection to external file.</li>
        <li>Rel attribute specifies 'relationship" between current document and linked document resource.</li>
        <li>Href attribute specifies URL of external resources and means location of URL.</li>
        <li>Class attribute allows us to share a CSS rule to any element.</li>
        <li>.card is a class selector. Any element with card attribute will gain properties from the CSS ( CSS card attribute changes card attribute in HTML.</li>
        <li>A border assigns a border with a width and color.</li>
        <li>Box-shadow adds shadow effects around the elements frame using X and Y offsets.</li>
        <li>X defines the widthon right side of box. Y defines below the box.</li>
        <li>Color = hex #.</li>

        <li>Gitbash is a software for windows commands.</li>
        <li>Git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
        <li>Git checkout -b (branch name): creates a new branch and switch to it.</li>
        <li>Git checkout (exisitng branch): switches to an exisiting branch.</li>
        <li>Git branch: lists the exisiting branches.</li>
        <li>'cd' stands for change direction (selecting) in gitbash.</li>
        <li>'cd ..' moves you back a level (back button).</li>
        <li>'mkdir' stands for make directory (create new file).</li>      
        <li>'pwd' stands for print working directory and it shows you the current directory you are working in.</li>
        <li>'ls' shows the list of files and folders in the working directory</li>
        <li>'touch' (file name).(file extention) creates a file. Ex: touch first-day.txt.</li>
        <li>Use 'ls' to check if file was created.</li>
        <li>To open a file in Windows, start (file name.file extention). In Mac, open (file name.file extention).</li>

        <li>A branch is a copy or version of a code that can be worked on independently in isolation so changes wont disrupt other team members.</li>
        <li>A branch is called a main branch, we don't code on the main.</li>
        <li>We work of the main branch so we create a feature branch</li>
        <li>A feature branch is a copy of main branch. It will keep track of changes that are made.</li>
        <li>In feature branch, make commits messages that describes what changed in the code.</li>
        <li>When changes are made push them in the respository (github).</li>
        <li>To merge chnages to the main branch, open a pull request.</li>
        <li>Pull request (PR): merges a comparison/feature branch into the base/main branch.</li>
        <li>A PR will get the code reviewed and approved then merged into the main branch. The main branch will be updated. If you want to make another change it will branch off the updated branch.</li>
        <li>When coding 'git' has to be in the front of every command.</li>
        <li>Git add -a: save changes.</li>

        <li>Git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge.</li>
        <li>Git fetch: downloads content from specific remote repository.
        <li>Git merge: merge changes from one branch to another.</li>
        <li>Always pull source before pushing changes!</li>
        <li>Git push origin (feature branch): upload changes to github.</li>
